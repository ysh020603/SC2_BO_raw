## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **LLM-Powered Agents:** Connect any powerful LLMs you want to try to control a player in StarCraft II.
*   **Human-like Reasoning:** Agents can perform high-level strategic planning, verify the validity of their plans, and self-correct their actions.
*   **Extensible Framework:** Easily add new agents, models, or custom game logic.
*   **Detailed Configuration:** Fine-tune every aspect of the match, from map and difficulty to race and AI build strategies.
*   **Benchmarking:** Test your agent against various built-in AI difficulty levels and builds to measure its performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local environment and start a match.

### 1. Install StarCraft II üéÆ

You need a local installation of the game. The free Starter Edition is sufficient.

*   **Windows / macOS:**
    1.  Download and install the game from the [official StarCraft II website](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/).
    2.  (Optional but recommended) In the Battle.net launcher settings, change the game language to English.

*   **Linux:**
    1.  Download the Linux game package from the [s2client-proto repository](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#linux-packages).
    2.  Set the `SC2PATH` environment variable to your installation directory.
        ```bash
        export SC2PATH="/path/to/StarCraftII"
        ```

### 2. Set Up Game Maps üó∫Ô∏è

Download the necessary map packs to run experiments.

1.  Download the map packs from the [s2client-proto repository](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#map-packs). The **`Melee`** pack is required.
2.  Create a `Maps` folder inside your StarCraft II installation directory if it doesn't exist.
3.  Unzip `Melee.zip` into the `Maps` folder using the password `iagreetotheeula`. Your final directory structure should look like this:
    ```
    /path/to/StarCraftII/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Maps/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Melee/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Flat32.SC2Map
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other maps)
    ```

### 3. Configure the Agent ü§ñ

Set up the Python environment and API keys for your LLM agent.

1.  **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anonymous/SC2Arena.git
    cd SC2Arena
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Configure API Keys:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the template:
    ```bash
    cp .env_template .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your LLM provider's API key and base URL.
    ```env
    # .env
    API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    BASE_URL="https://api.example.com/v1"
    ```
    Alternatively, you can set these as environment variables or pass them as command-line arguments.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running a Battle

You are now ready to launch a match! Run `main.py` with your desired configuration.

```bash
python main.py \
    --map_name Flat32 \
